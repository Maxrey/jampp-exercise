# Home Test exercise

Dear Evaluation team,

Hi there! this is the solution for the home test exercise.
Each of the folders contain the files for each exercise:

  - /coding : contains 5 pieces of code. coding_exercise_final is the corrected function. Open the files sequentially to see the reasoning process to reach that solution
  - /analytics: contains a word file explaining the query and an example of it's application in business.
  - /math: contains a word file with the solution to the problem and an excel file for the calculations.
  
  Thanks a lot for your time.
  
  Looking forward to your response and feedback,
  
  Maximilian Rey
